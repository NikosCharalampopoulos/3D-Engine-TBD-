// Owns a Window and drives the main loop: poll events -> update -> render
// -> swap, once per frame, until the window should close or ESC is
// pressed. Computes delta-time and a frame count each iteration -- nothing
// consumes them yet, but later phases (animation, physics, camera
// movement, FPS display) will need exactly this, so the pattern is
// established here rather than bolted on later. Deliberately does not grow
// into a scene graph / ECS / callback system -- that's later phases' job.
//
// Phase 2 added the first real rendered content: render() draws a shaded
// cube via a Shader + Mesh instead of just clearing the framebuffer.
//
// Phase 3 replaces Phase 2's hardcoded eye position + hand-rolled view/
// projection matrices with a real Camera (view/projection) and Transform
// (the cube's model matrix). update() now feeds delta-time and input into
// camera_ every frame -- either real WASD/mouse input via Window, or (when
// ENGINE_CAMERA_DEMO is set) a small deterministic scripted path, since
// there's no real keyboard/mouse under the headless Xvfb verification
// harness. See update()'s definition for both paths.
